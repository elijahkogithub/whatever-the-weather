<h1>Hot Spell Expelliarmus - Your personal heatwave alert</h1>

Now that lockdown is continuing to ease, we're excited about the prospect of enjoying, safely, more of the great outdoors this summer. That also means a return to the very British hobby of getting sun tanning üîÜ in the parks üèû!

However, even if you can enjoy the weather and manage social distancing, you could be vulnerable to heat exhaustion ü•µ. Particularly the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors. Heat-stroke may set in which requires urgent medical help.

What if ... you can receive a hot spell warning once you step into your favourite local parks?

The project can be broken down into three main sections:

<h3>1. Trigger an IFTTT command once you step into the park (IF "Location" THEN "Webhooks")</h3>
   <brIF THIS -   "Location: widget</br>
                Select "You enter an area", this triggers everytime you enter an area you specify. In my case, I have chosen the Roundwood Park.
   <br>THEN THAT - "Webhooks" widget</br>
                <br>URL field, fill in "https://yourAccountName.pythonanywhere.com/ifttt</br>
                <br>Method: POST (optional)</br>
                <br>Content Type: text/plain (optional)</br>
                <br>Body: (optional)</br>
    
2. IFTTT send a Webhook request (server) to Pythonanywhere.com to auto run the "hot_spell_expelliarmus.py" (client)
   - copy and paste the "hot_spell_expelliarmus.py" to (pythonanywhere.com > home > username > yourDirectory)
   - rememebr to "save" and "run" the program
   - Go to Dashboard > Web Apps (Open Web tab) > click "Reload yourAccountName.pythonanywhere.com"
   
3a. Grabbing weather data ("hot_spell_expelliarmus.py"):
    - Make API call from https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api, to get current and forecast weather data.
    - https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude={part}&appid={YOUR API KEY}
    - Open an account from OpenWeather.com to gain your unique API key

3b. Processing data:
    Using Python to parse the acquired data. If temperature in the next 2 hours is over 30 degree Celsius. Trigger an alert message to your email.
    
3c. Trigger output:
    Send alert to your mailbox with the following messages.
    "Subject: HOT SPELL ALERT!
     Body: Temperature in 2 hours will be {this_temp} degree Celsius.
           Stay cool and drink more water!"
